Dr. McArthur is a Professor and David Braley Chair in Computational Biology at McMaster University. Dr. McArthur has had a career in the United States and Canada, including NIH-funded positions at the Marine Biological Laboratory and Brown University, where he led the genome assembly of the diarrheal pathogen Giardia intestinalis, plus 10 years of experience in the private sector. Dr. McArthur’s research team focuses on building tools, databases, and algorithms for the genomic surveillance of infectious pathogens. He and his team developed the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (card.mcmaster.ca) and the SARS-CoV-2 Illumina GeNome Assembly Line software platform

Rob Beiko is a professor in bioinformatics whose research encompasses microbial evolution and gene transfer, comparative genomics, and microbial community analysis. He is the lead of the ARETE project, which is developing a software pipeline for annotation of AMR and mobile genetic elements, phylogenomic analysis, and inference of recombination and transfer in large sets of pathogen genomes. He has also developed and contributed to software tools including STAMP for statistical analysis of metagenome profiles, rSPR for efficient inference of gene transmission, and PICRUSt for the prediction of metagenome composition based on marker-gene surveys.
